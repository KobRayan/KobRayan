### About Me

I am a fourth-year engineering student at **Polytech Nancy** (equivalent to a Master's 1st year), specializing in Computer Science, Robotics, and Automation. Previously, I graduated as **Valedictorian** of my class with a Bachelor of Science in Electronics and Automation from Université de Caen Normandie.

Currently, I split my time between France for my studies and Moncton, New Brunswick. I am actively looking for internship opportunities in **Software Engineering**, **Automation**, or **Web Development** starting April 2026 (3-4 months).

**Status:** Canadian Permanent Resident

**Location Preference:**
* **Moncton, NB** (On-site)
* **Remote** (Anywhere in Canada)

### Selected Projects

**Polytech Science Fair Management System (SaaS)**
Architected a full-stack booking system for university events using Spring Boot and Angular. Designed the relational database (MySQL) to manage complex schedules and implemented role-based access control for administrators, participants, and workshop leaders.

**DNA Duplication for PCR**
Designed a closed-loop PID control system in LabVIEW to automate DNA sample heating cycles. Integrated thermal sensors to ensure strict biomedical stability during the amplification process.

### Work Ethic & Background

Beyond technical skills, I differentiate myself as a rigorous student and fast learner driven by resilience and discipline. I have fully self-funded my engineering education by working as a Server/Head Waiter in high-volume environments (in both Canada and France), a role that honed my leadership skills and ability to perform under pressure. I apply this same rigor and consistency to my engineering projects.
