Aspiring Engineer currently training at Polytech Nancy (Specializing in IT, Automation, Robotics, and Networks). I split my time between France for my studies and Moncton, New Brunswick, my home base.

Currently looking for an internship (Fields: Automation, Web Dev, Robotics, Software Engineering).

I am passionate about the convergence of software development and automated systems. My goal is to contribute to the industrialization and optimization of these processes within an innovative company.

What defines me:

> Technical: I am a fast learner with a strong command of development and modeling software (IT, Automation, Networks).

> Mindset: "A healthy mind in a healthy body." As a dedicated weight training enthusiast for the past 3 years, I apply the same rigor, discipline, and consistency to my professional projects as I do to my sport.

Feel free to contact me to discuss technical projects or internship opportunities in Moncton or Nancy!
